code for shortlisting candidates based on their qualifications and experience:

This code defines a list of candidates with their qualifications and experience, and specifies the minimum qualifications and experience required for the job. It then loops through the candidates and checks if they meet the minimum requirements, and adds them to a new list if they do. Finally, it prints the names of the shortlisted candidates. Note that this code is just an example and can be adapted to different use cases and requirements.

# Define a list of candidates with their qualifications and experience
candidates = [
    {'name': 'John', 'qualification': 'Bachelor of Science', 'experience': 3},
    {'name': 'Jane', 'qualification': 'Master of Science', 'experience': 5},
    {'name': 'Bob', 'qualification': 'PhD', 'experience': 2},
    {'name': 'Alice', 'qualification': 'Bachelor of Science', 'experience': 4},
]

# Define the minimum qualifications and experience required for the job
min_qualification = 'Bachelor of Science'
min_experience = 3

# Initialize an empty list to store the shortlisted candidates
shortlisted_candidates = []

# Loop through the candidates and check if they meet the minimum qualifications and experience
for candidate in candidates:
    if candidate['qualification'] >= min_qualification and candidate['experience'] >= min_experience:
        shortlisted_candidates.append(candidate)

# Print the shortlisted candidates
print('Shortlisted candidates:')
for candidate in shortlisted_candidates:
    print(candidate['name'])
