# The project is named "Talent Match" and it aims to assist the Human Resource staff in identifying the manpower needed for all departments and to help them shortlist the best candidates for the job openings. Talent Match will use AI to analyze job requirements, skills, and experience of the candidates to match them with the most suitable job positions.
Background:
The problem Talent Match aims to solve is the increasing difficulty for HR staff to identify the right candidates for job openings. The hiring process can be time-consuming, expensive, and not always yield the best results. The problem is frequent, especially for companies with large workforces and multiple departments. My personal motivation to work on this project is to help streamline the hiring process, reduce hiring time, and increase the chances of finding the best candidates. This topic is important because finding the right talent can significantly impact a company's success.
Data and AI techniques:
Talent Match will use job descriptions, candidate resumes, and historical employee data to analyze and match candidates with job openings. The AI techniques that will be used are natural language processing (NLP) to analyze job requirements and candidate resumes, machine learning to predict the most suitable job positions for each candidate, and data visualization to present the results to HR staff. A concrete demo will be implemented using actual job descriptions and candidate resumes to showcase Talent Match's ability to match candidates with job openings.
How it is used:
Talent Match will be used by HR staff to assist them in identifying the right candidates for job openings. The solution will provide a shortlist of the best candidates for each job position, making the hiring process more efficient and effective. People affected by this solution include HR staff and job candidates who will benefit from a more streamlined and accurate hiring process.
Challenges:
Talent Match does not solve the problem of bias in the hiring process, which can affect the diversity of the workforce. While the AI will analyze job requirements and candidate resumes objectively, the selection of the final candidate should still be done by humans to avoid potential bias.
What next:
In the future, Talent Match could be expanded to include additional data sources, such as social media profiles and job references, to provide a more complete picture of each candidate. It could also be integrated with other HR systems, such as applicant tracking systems and HR analytics tools, to provide a more comprehensive HR solution.

Acknowledgments:
The inspiration for Talent Match came from the increasing demand for AI solutions in the HR industry. The NLP and machine learning techniques used in Talent Match were inspired by OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Google's AutoML platform. The demo will be implemented using open source code from GitHub, and credit will be given to the creators.
